//! A read-only JSON API over the bundled guides, and through it the site's MCP
//! server.
//!
//! The site already holds every Autumn and Harvest guide in memory, already
//! indexes them for search, and is already redeployed whenever upstream docs
//! move. That makes it the natural place to answer the question a coding agent
//! keeps getting wrong: *what does this version of Autumn actually do?* An
//! agent that can call [`search_autumn_docs`] and [`get_autumn_doc`] reads the
//! guides for the release that is deployed, instead of recalling whatever it
//! saw during training.
//!
//! Every handler here is an ordinary Autumn route returning `Json<T>`. Tagging
//! them `#[api_doc(mcp)]` and calling `mount_mcp("/mcp")` in `main` is the
//! whole MCP server: Autumn derives the tool catalog from the same `ApiDoc`
//! metadata that drives its OpenAPI document, so the tool schemas cannot drift
//! from these signatures. See `content/guide/mcp.md` for the mechanism.
//!
//! ## Why the tools are shaped this way
//!
//! The guides are not uniformly sized. Most are a few kilobytes, but
//! `deployment.md` is over 150 KB — roughly forty thousand tokens, more than an
//! agent should ever receive from one tool call. So [`get_autumn_doc`] returns
//! Markdown only while it fits [`MAX_INLINE_DOC_BYTES`]; past that it withholds
//! the body — save for its introduction, if one fits, since narrowing to a
//! heading in `sections` can never return what precedes it — and returns the
//! headings nested inside what was asked for, letting the agent narrow and ask
//! again. Section ids are the anchors the rendered page already uses, so a
//! section reference is also a working deep link a human can open.
//!
//! The gate applies to a requested *section* just as it does to a whole guide.
//! A `##` section of the deployment guide is 76 KB on its own, so exempting the
//! section path would have reopened the hole on the very call the notice tells
//! an agent to make. See [`gate_by_size`].
