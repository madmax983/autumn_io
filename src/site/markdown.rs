//! The Markdown twin of every page [`crate::site`] renders as HTML.
//!
//! Each function here answers the same request as the `render_*` function it
//! sits beside in the parent module, for a client that asked for
//! `text/markdown` (see [`crate::negotiate`]). A guide's body needs no
//! conversion — the site holds the Markdown the HTML was rendered *from*, so
//! the agent gets the author's source, not a lossy round trip through
//! syntax-highlighted markup.
//!
//! What is written here is the *page around* that body: the title, the
//! description, the navigation, and, for the home page, the prose that exists
//! only inside `html!` macros. Those strings are shared constants in the parent
//! module rather than copies, so the two representations cannot drift on the
//! facts. The framing differs deliberately — an agent gets a linked guide index
//! where a reader gets a sidebar, and no skip link, header, or footer chrome at
//! all.
